# Python Coding Task

# Description

In this file, I will document my code.

## Setup Information

First and foremost, to ensure that no issues arise when you try to run my code on your computers, I would like to provide information about my setup.

## My Setup

The setup I used is as follows:

- **Python Version**: [Python 3.10.11]  
- **Processor Type**: [x64-Bit-Betriebssystem, x64-basierter Prozessor]  
- **IDE/Editor Used**: [Visual Studio Code]  

## Documentation

## Functions
- **None**

## Variables
- **`t`**: The current local time.
- **`current_time`**: The current time formatted as HH:MM:SS.
- **`i`**: The number of bottles of beer on the wall.

## User Interaction
- Prompts the user to take another bottle down with allowed answers:
  - `"yes"`
  - `"y"`
  - `"no"`
  - `"n"`
- If the user chooses to take another bottle down, the count decreases.
- If the count reaches 0, the script prompts the user to buy more bottles.

## Notes
- The loop continues indefinitely until the script is manually stopped.
